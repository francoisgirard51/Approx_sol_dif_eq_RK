Approximate solutions of differential equations using the Runge-Khuta method

INTRODUCTION

- We consider a general differential equation of order 1 which is written: y'=f(t,y) where f is a function of two variables.
- A solution of this equation is a function y(t) such that for all t we have:  y'(t) = f((t,y(t)).
- For a general function f, we don't have a formula to express the solutions of the equations, but we can draw approximate solutions.

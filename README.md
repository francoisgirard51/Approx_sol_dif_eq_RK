Approximate solutions of differential equations using the Runge-Khuta method

- We consider a general differential equation of order 1 which is written: $y'=f(t,y)$ where $f$ is a function of two variables.
- A solution of this equation is a function $y(t)$ such that for all $t$ we have: $ y'(t) = f\bigl(t,y(t)\bigr)$.
- For a general function $f$, we don't have a formula to express the solutions of the equations, but we can draw approximate solutions.
